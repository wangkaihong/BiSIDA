# BiSIDA: Bidirectional Style-induced Domain Adaptation
Code of our AAAI 2021 paper: [Consistency Regularization with High-dimensional Non-adversarial Source-guided Perturbation for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation in Segmentation](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/17216)

Our Bidirectional Style-Induced Domain Adaptation (BiSIDA) employs consistency regularization to efficiently exploit information from the unlabeled target domain dataset, requiring only a simple ****neural style transfer**** model. 

BiSIDA aligns domains by:
* transferring source images into the style of target images for supervised learning; 
* transferring target images into the style of source images to perform high-dimensional perturbation on the unlabeled target images for unsupervised learning.

# Usage

1. Download the pretrained VGG model required by both the our style transfer network and FCN, and put it into saved_models/.

   VGG initializations is available through this [link.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11PbJLLd9C3-Aj4yiRbJoDgEZyfZn3dIv/view?usp=sharing)
   
2. Pretraining of our continuous style-induced image generator ([AdaIN](https://github.com/xunhuang1995/AdaIN-style)).

   > python adain/train/train_0_1.py
   
   An example of our continuous style-induced image generator transferring an image in SYNTHIA to a image in CityScapes with different alpha ranging from 0 to 1 with an increment of 0.2.
